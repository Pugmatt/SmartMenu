# Sprint Backlog (2019-02-01 to 2019-02-19)

NOTE: The members in the group were learning how to work with the programming language and Angular. The setup of the project was taken care of by Matthew, which is why all Owners show as Matthew, but while also showing the process to team members to make sure everyone is on the same page and knows how to work with the development environment. Team members were still involved with development. Now that all team members know how to use the development languages and tools, sprints after this one will contain user story Owners containing all members of the group. 

| ID | User Story | Priority | Owner |
|----|------------|----------|-------|
| 000 | As a user, I want a search box, so I can find restaurants and foot items quicker. | HIGH | Matthew |
| 001 | As a user, I want an easy to find log in button, so I can log in easily when I open the website. | HIGH | Matthew |
| 002 | As a user, I want an easy to find register button, so I can register easily when I open the website. | HIGH | Matthew |
| 003 | As a user, I want to be able to add a location into the search box, so I can find restaurants around this specific location. | MEDIUM | Matthew |
| 004 | As a user, I want to see the logo of the company, so the design of the site is more pleasing to look at. | LOW | Matthew |
| 005 | As a user, I want a list of all restaurants listed, so I can see the variety of options for restaurants available. | HIGH | Matthew |
