## Vision Statement

This project would be created for restaurant consumers and restaurant owners, that needs a website to list specific items and allow consumer feedback for restaurants. Smart Menu is a website that allows the consumer to find more details about dishes for a restaurant and leave feedback and photos. Unlike Yelp, which only lists restaurants as a whole, Smart Menu can be used to help customers get more feedback and information on what a specific food item is like before ordering (nutritional facts, size, proportions, etc). Restaurant owners can use it to get a better idea of what food items are succeeding, and what is not as popular among customers.
